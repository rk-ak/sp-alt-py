Alteryx - General Tips:

1. Use select tool to use only the required fields. It will save a lot of execution time. It can also be used to change data type and rename field.
2. Use formula tool instead of other calculation or action tools, as formula tools is super fast compared to other tools eg: impute tool. One formula tool can contain multiple formulas.
    It can be used to change existing field or to create a new field. Although data type of existing field cannot be changed using the formula tool.
3. Use .csv file exports or imports instead of excel files, as they execute faster than the excel files.
4. Use command tool to execute other programs in Alteryx workflow, like python.
5. Use unique tool if you suspect that the input data source might contain duplicate records.
6. Use the correct join tool for combining two input data sources, as each kind of join tool is specifically designed to perform an unique task.
7. Use tool container to segregate the workflow into manageable sections. Color of a tool container can also be changed as required.
8. Use native file exports as requried as it saves a lot of file format conversion time, eg: tde or hyper files exports for tableau dashboards.
